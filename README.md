A simple night-light for my fridge - on whose door it is velcro-ed on:

Works beautifully, detecting when I approach and lighting up.

I left some room on the perfboard to add a TP4056 and a 600mAh LiPo (waiting
for both of them to arrive from e-Bay). At a power consumption of less than
0.8mA, I estimate I will need to recharge this once a month.
